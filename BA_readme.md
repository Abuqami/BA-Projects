This project leverages two datasets, namely the Chinook Music Store database and the Flight Weather Delays dataset, to gain insights and make informed business decisions.



## Chinook Music Store
The Chinook Music Store Database is a fictional database that I have worked with as part of my business analytics projects. This database provides a comprehensive collection of data related to a music retail business, including information about customers, employees, sales, and inventory.
